    <h1>Data Visualiser</h1>
    <p>
      The primary assessment for the Graphics 1 module was to create a program to visualise data using C++ and OpenGL. My final submission also used the Win32 API and a version of GLFont that was modified by the graphics lecturer to remove dependency on OpenGL extensions. This program allows you to open a CSV file and view it's contents as one of several graphs; pie chart, bar graph, 2D scatter plot, 3D scatter plot, line graph and spider chart. You can then select several specific columns within the data and display the data in those columns. Each graph can be panned, zoomed, and the data it displays can be selected, all using the left mouse button. The 3d scatter plot can also be rotated using the right mouse button. When data is selected details about it will be displayed in both the controls window and the visualisation window. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-148" src="https://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-2015-05-07-00-39-53.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-07 00.39.53" width="300" height="169" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-141" src="https://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screenshot-2015-05-07-00-41-27.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-07 00.41.27" width="300" height="169" /> <a href="http://download1081.mediafire.com/t87oko7ehjxg/ee9bec2d6750czx/DataVisualiser.zip">Download</a> (Note: There appears to be some problem with the .exe crashing. For some reason this gets fixed on windows 7 by moving the .exe and the font file to the desktop and running it from there. Update: It seems that this is somehow caused by SmartScreen, as deactivating it allows the program to run fine.)
