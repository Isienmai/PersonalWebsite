    <h1>Pai Sho</h1>
    <p>
      This is a personal project written over the summer in C++ using SDL. It is an incredibly stripped down version of Pai Sho, a board game played in the TV show "Avatar: The last airbender". Unfortunately, after much research it has become apparent that the creators of the show did not create a ruleset for the game. Beyond the appearance of the board and some of the tiles the show is actually quite inconsistent when it comes to the rules. As you can probably guess this makes creating a playable version of the game a nightmare, especially since pai sho is only rarely shown, and yet the show still manages to contradict itself concerning the rules multiple times. Despite all this the fan community has come up with several sets of rules which could be used, however they are all quite complex and some of the rulesets differ too much from what is actually shown in the show for my liking. However, common ground between the rules is the use of 6 flower tiles to create harmonies/disharmonies to generate points, and 6 other unique tiles with special effects. For simplicities sake the 6 unique tiles have been left out of my version of the game and I have focused only on the 6 flower tiles, 3 red and 3 white. Currently the game can be played by two players on the same computer. Each player starts off with 3 of each tile. On your turn you may add a new tile to the board at any unoccupied  location, or move one of your tiles to any unoccupied location. Currently there are no win/lose conditions, you can only create harmonies/disharmonies using your own tiles, tiles can be placed in/moved to any free location and there are no menus or settings. <a href="https://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screenshot-2014-09-17-20-45-37.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69" src="http://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screenshot-2014-09-17-20-45-37.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot 2014-09-17 20.45.37" width="300" height="244" /></a><a href="https://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screenshot-2014-09-17-21-28-19.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-70" src="http://benstrutt.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screenshot-2014-09-17-21-28-19.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot 2014-09-17 21.28.19" width="300" height="244" /></a> <a href="http://download1502.mediafire.com/qno3qdsobs8g/btt43ilcg6xd551/PaiSho.zip">Download</a> Update: Production is on hold for now.
