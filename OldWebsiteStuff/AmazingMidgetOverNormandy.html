      <h1>Amazing Midget over Normandy</h1>
      <p>
        This game was created back in 2014 during a 48 hour long game jam.
        The setup was simple, you generate three random names using <a href="https://videogamena.me/">videogamena.me</a> and get to pick the one you like most. If you didn't like any of them you got to generate a fourth name that you then had to use.
        We of course ended up with the name "Amazing Midget Over Normandy" (quickly shortened to AMON).
        As first year uni students, we used basic C# and XNA framework to build this thing. It was a pretty good time!
        We ended up with game a minute long survival game in which you play as a parachuting midget trying to land at Normandy. During the long fall the character needs to dodge missiles, planes, and clouds.
        The game mostly consists of trying to collect powerups, avoid obstacles, and sometimes dropping bombs.
