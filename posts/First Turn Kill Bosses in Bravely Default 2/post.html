	<h1>First Turn Kill (Almost) All Bosses in Bravely Default 2</h1>
	<p>So while playing Bravely Default 2 I accidentally a build that can first turn kill most endgame bosses. This was not the plan, and it trivialised the endgame to the same extent as if I'd just hacked in an infinite damage attack. Ooops. On the upside I'm kinda proud of the build so I decided to write this post explaining what it is and how it works.</p>
