	<h1>First Turn Kill (Almost) All Bosses in Bravely Default 2</h1>
	<p>So while playing Bravely Default 2 I accidentally a build that can first turn kill most endgame bosses. This was not the plan, and it trivialised the endgame to the same extent as if I'd just hacked in an infinite damage attack. Ooops. On the upside I'm kinda proud of the build so I decided to write this post explaining what it is and how it works.</p>
	<p>Note: This post assumes you are putting this build on Adelle because that's what I did. You can of course put it on whoever you want I ain't yo dad.</p>

	<h1>The Build:</h1>
		<p>The basic idea of this build is low health = big damage, and going berserk = free abilities! Making one ability particularly OP and then spamming it to kingdom come is the name of the game.</p>
	<h2>Classes</h2>
	<img src = "./ActiveJobs.png" alt = "Main: Phantom Lv 12, Sub: Berserker Lv 15"/>
	<img src = "./DiabolismJob.png" alt = "Diabolism Lv 14"/>
	<img src = "./BraveryJob.png" alt = "Bravery Lv 10"/>
	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<img src = "./PassiveAbilities.png" alt = "Diabolism: Surpassing Power, Last Resort; Berserker: Bloody-Minded, Free-for-All; Bravery: Sub-Job Speciality 2"/>
	<h2>Equipment (Not optimised. Change it up however you want)</h2>
	<img src = "./Equipment.png" alt = "Eurytos' Bow, Headband, Brave Suit, Sensei's Belt, Life Ring"/>
	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<img src = "./Stats.png" alt = "Big Physical Attack(385), Speed(208), and Crit Chance(65)"/>
	<h2>How to Win</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Ideally Adelle should start out with 1 HP and at least 58 MP. Everytime Adelle attacks her health will drop but it won't go below 1HP, so go ham on some regular enemies until you get there.</li>
		<li>Start the fight and ideally Adelle will go first. If she doesn't then just do whatever until she gets a turn. Don't forget to keep her health low!</li>
		<li>Brave as much as possible</li>
		<li>Use Vent Fury for that sweet Berserk damage bonus and Free Attacks!</li>
		<li>Cast Death's Door three times</li>
		<li>Watch and laugh as your enemies fall beneath the spicy wrath of approximately 180,000 damage</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Extra Recommendations</h2>
	<p>So Casting Death's Door three times in a turn is nice, but there are a few things that can really sweeten the deal. Unfortunately they require a turn setup and poor Adelle is sitting 1 bee string from death at all times, so here's what you do.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Setup another team member as a Shieldmaster with big defence and health. They will automatically take all damage directed at Adelle because she's on such low health. This lets you spend turn 1 doing setup and turn 2 going HAM.</li>
		<li>On turn 1 we want to buff Adelle as much as possible. Spend as many Braves as you can afford (we need her to act next turn so avoid going negative if you can).</li>
		<li>Drop whatever buffs you can, I like Phantom Lv 15: Ethereal Edge plus stacking Phantom Lv 2: Become the Lightning (costs 20% to cast, so plan for it and start at like just over 20% or 40% health. Then casting it will drop you down to the FUN zone)</li>
		<li>Use Vent Fury</li>
		<li>Survive the round</li>
		<li>Cast Death's Door FOUR times</li>
		<li>Watch and laugh as your enemies fall beneath the spicy wrath of good CHRIST that just took out the final boss turn 2. Oops.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>How does the build work?</h1>
	// Show the RTSR Combo (Berserker attack, Sword guy ability, Dont miss thing, Also maybe Ninja hurt for buff thing)
	// Show the free attacks combo (Berserker ability 2 + Phantom ability 2 + Free berserk)
	// Extra stuff (Hight crit chance, Surpassing Power, high speed means she go first)
