    <h1>Blitz Blox</h1>
    <p>
      Blitz Blox is a game that I worked on with a team of 3 others.
      It is a small phone-app style game created in Unity, inspired in part by Tetris and that game where you fire bubbles at other bubbles (and has so many different clones that searching for the name of the original has proved fruitless).
