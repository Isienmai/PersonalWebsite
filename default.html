      <h1>Where Am I?</h1>
      <p>You are on a website. You are on MY website. This site is basically an excuse to learn how to put together a website from scratch.</p>
      <p>It's got all kinds of nonsense, mainly focused on things I've done. Some is just pictures of nerd shit, the rest is gonna be paragraphs on the dumb things I've tried and how I did them.</p>
      <p>If you like asking questions such as "Why would you do that?" and "Isn't that just making things more complicated?" then you've come to the right place.</p>
      <h2>Who Are You?</h2>
      <p>I am Ben</p>
      <p>Howdy</p>
      <p>I do programming and other assorted techy things. I also do other unrelated nerd stuff that'll probably end up on here at some point.</p>
      <p>The Sidebar has probably got a list of categories of things assuming I made it correctly...and assuming I've actually put stuff on the site.</p>
      <h3>WHAT YEAR IS IT?</h3>
      <p>2019. I know "experts" may disagree with me but what do they know?</p>
      <!TODO: Grab and display the current year in various different calendars for fun/>
